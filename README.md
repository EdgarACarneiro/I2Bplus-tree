The ___Interval B+ tree (IB+ tree)___ is a valid-time indexing structure, first introduced by [Bozkaya and Ozsoyoglu](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221465339_Indexing_Valid_Time_Intervals). This indexing structure appears as a time-efficient indexing structure for the management of valid-time/ intervals.

In this repository, we present the ___Improved Interval B+ tree (I2B+ tree)___, an indexing structure based on the _IB+ tree_, but with minor structural changes to improve the performance of the deletion operation. For a more detailed analysis of the _I2B+ tree_, refer to the paper \* _being published_ \* in the [CISTI'2020 Conference](http://www.cisti.eu).

This structure performs all operations (insertion, search and deletion) with logarithmic performance (_O (log n)_). Documentation is available [here](https://edgaracarneiro.github.io/I2Bplus-tree/).

For an in-depth analysis of both the parameter tuning (such as the tree's order or the time-splits alpha value) and the conclusions obtained from the performance analysis of the _I2B+ tree_, check the [benchmarks folder](https://github.com/EdgarACarneiro/IBplusTree/tree/master/benchmarks).

# Usage

To suit the _I2BplusTree_ to your needs, implement a class that __extends the [FlatInterval](https://github.com/EdgarACarneiro/IBplusTree/blob/master/src/FlatInterval.ts)__ class, defining the information that will be stored on leaves there. One might also want to override the `equals` method, thus allowing the incorporation of the extra information stored in the Intervals in comparisons.
